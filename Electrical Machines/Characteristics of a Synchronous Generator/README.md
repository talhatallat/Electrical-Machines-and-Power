# Characteristics of a Synchronous Generator

## Objectives
* Simulate OC test, SC test of a stand alone Synchronous Generator, Typical graphs expected 
are: oc curve, sc curve after the simulation.
* Simulate Load test on a Synchronous generator with R, L and C type load and plot the 
Terminal voltage vs stator current in the same graph load curve ( Va vs Ia where If is 
constant);
* Find the Xs value from simulation results and check how close it is to input parameter you 
have selected

## Self Directed Learning

1. What is a V- curve of a Synchronous Machine; show by drawing a v- curve how does the 
synchronous motor curve differ from a synchronous generator curve.
2. Describe with a diagram what is a constant power locus of a synchronous machine? Will it 
be restricted by any specific power factor?
3. Draw a phasor diagram of a cylindrical rotor synchronous motor when it is running at unity 
power factor condition.
4. How can you vary speed of a synchronous motor?
