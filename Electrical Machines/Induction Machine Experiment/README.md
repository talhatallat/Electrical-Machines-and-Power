# Induction Machine Experiment

## Objectives

Choose pre-loaded machine parameters in the Simulink asynchronous squirrel-cage machine model. 

Carry out the no-load test (rated voltage and Tm = and locked rotor test (for rated current) and select the rating of the model.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  A)	Torque speed characteristic of a squirrel cage induction motor 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  B)	Equivalent circuit determination of a squirrel cage induction motor 

### 1. 
Provide appropriate graph and comment on the results on the torque speed characteristic of the induction motor 

### 2. 
Provide appropriate graph and comment on the results on the stator current speed characteristic of the induction motor.

### 3. 
Derive the model of equivalent circuit and show all the necessary calculations for derivation of the parameters.

### 4. 
Write a matlab program using the equivalent circuit. You must use the equivalent circuit to include all branches and components R1, R2, RC, Xm, X1, and X2. Plot torque vs. speed in RPM curves and stator current vs. speed in RPM for 80%, 90% and 100% of rated voltage as speed varies from 1 to 1500 RPM. 

[Note: Plot the three different voltage cases for torque on the same plot. 

Hint: Figure command can be used to plot the three curves on the same plot. Include MATLAB program 
listing and plot output in fig files.

### 5. 
Change the equivalent circuit by increasing the resistor R2 in the rotor by some 40% amount of the equivalent circuit and recalculate the curves as above with V rated = 100%. This new set of curves is equivalent to adding resistance to the rotor of the machine. 

Comment on the differences noted between using stator voltage control and adding rotor 
resistance, to control the speed of the motor. [Refer to any Text book on machines for appropriate
