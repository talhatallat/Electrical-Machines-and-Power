# DC Voltage regulation Assignment:

## Report contains the following

* Findings from the DC voltage regulation lab including circuit diagrams, waveforms and 
answers to any questions asked.

* Design a Buck-Boost switching DC supply capable of delivering the output voltages listed in the 
table below (note the change in input voltage also). Your supply should also meet the design 
constraints (various ripples etc) specified and all calculations should be shown.
